but also notes that patients with cardiovascular diseases have a significantly increased risk of death.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf" title="Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)">[WHO:feb-joint]</a>, 80% of cases have mild to moderate disease. What &quot;mild&quot; or &quot;moderate&quot; means is yet to be defined <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/814691018/coronavirus-symptoms-defining-mild-moderate-and-severe" title="Coronavirus Symptoms: Defining Mild, Moderate And Severe">[newspaper:npr-mild]</a>, but &quot;like flu, possibly pneumonia&quot;.</p>
<p>Some nice-looking graphs:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.arik.io/" title="COVID-19 Progression">[arik:progression]</a> claims to use same dataset.</p>
<p>NOTE: the default view <em>&quot;Deaths&quot; to &quot;Relative to Known Outcomes&quot;</em> metric is rubbish at this point.
Rationale/example: no recoveries yet in Poland (this takes time),
but 3 fatalities (as of 2020-03-15 19:26:53-07:00), which gives (false!) 100% case fatality rate.</p>

<p>To quote <em>Main results</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest quality cluster‐RCTs [<em>randomised controlled trials</em>] suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case‐control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non‐inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non‐significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most people infected with COVID-19 virus have mild disease and recover. Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild
to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 13.8% have severe disease (dyspnea, respiratory frequency 30/minute,
blood oxygen saturation 93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours)
and 6.1% are critical (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). Asymptomatic infection has been reported,
but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease.
The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver
of transmission. Individuals at highest risk for severe disease and death include people aged over 60 years and those with underlying conditions
such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer. Disease in children appears to be relatively rare
and mild with approximately 2.4% of the total reported cases reported amongst individuals aged under 19 years.
A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%).</p>
