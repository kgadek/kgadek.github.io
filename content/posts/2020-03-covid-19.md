# Q & A




## Should I use a mask?

Why not, but *wear it properly*.

TL;DR:

* how to wear: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrvFrH_npQI>
* how to make mask at home: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlsbeO0Rk1M>

More knowledge:

* commentary with list of links: <https://old.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ffy8av/data_from_sars_outbreak_showed_that_mask_wearing/fk1a4yx/?context=0>



## Handwashing helps?

Yes.

* soap is just good [\[newspaper:weforum-soap\]],
* 70% alcohol is fine, below 60% is too low [\[newspaper:onet-alkohol\]] while over 90% is too much (water helps dissolve virus).



## Mortality statistics?

Difficult to answer. We know:

* how many people, who got symptoms, were positively diagnosed,
* more about Hubei, China than other parts of the world,
* that statistics per country are vastly different - compare Italy to South Korea,
* that seasonal flu has around 0.1% mortality rate [\[newspaper:livescience-flu\]].

We don't know:

* how many got infected but don't have symptoms yet (Hubei: 5.6 days of incubation period [\[Riou:hubei\]]),
* how many got infected but don't have symptoms at all (Hubei: 51% of cases),
* how many cases went undiagnosed because it was mild, of shortage of tests, for political reasons,
  or any other reasons (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 "the virus" gave falses positives to dengue fever [\[newspaper:dengue\]]).

We don't have full picture *yet*. Yet, we have e.g. [\[Riou:hubei\]] article about Hubei, China.
TL;DR:

* overall population: 1.6% case fatality ratio among all symptomatic & asymptomatic infections (95% confidence interval: 1.4-1.8),
* 0-9 years old: 0.0094% (0-0.058),
* 10-19 years old: 0.022% (0-0.082),
* 20-29 years old: 0.091% (0.03-0.2),
* 30-39 years old: 0.18% (0.096-0.3),
* 40-49 years old: 0.4% (0.26-0.58),
* 50-59 years old: 1.3% (1-1.6),
* 60-69 years old: 4.6% (3.8-5.4),
* 70-79 years old: 9.8% (8.2-12),
* 80+ years old: 18% (14-22).

Some nice-looking graphs:

* [\[ArcGIS:COVID-19\]] - popular dashboard
* [\[arik:progression\]] claims to use same dataset.
  However, note that the default *"Deaths" to "Relative to Known Outcomes"* metric is
  rubbish at this point.

  Example: it's early stage in Poland so no recoveries yet.
  However, we have 3 fatalities (as of 2020-03-15 19:26:53-07:00).
  That gives us (misleading!) 100% case fatality rate.

To quote *Main results*:
> The highest quality cluster‐RCTs \[*randomised controlled trials*\] suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Benefit from reduced transmission from children to household members is broadly supported also in other study designs where the potential for confounding is greater. Nine case‐control studies suggested implementing transmission barriers, isolation and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. Surgical masks or N95 respirators were the most consistent and comprehensive supportive measures. N95 respirators were non‐inferior to simple surgical masks but more expensive, uncomfortable and irritating to skin. Adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease transmission remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, led to a non‐significant marginal delay in spread. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective, especially if related to the risk of exposure.
