It's a&nbsp;<em>personal</em> blog with my own opinions, and I&nbsp;do not represent <code>$$ANYONE_ELSE</code> here in any way.
I&nbsp;may change opinions without warning!
I&nbsp;may be wrong.
I&nbsp;may or may not like pie.
I&nbsp;do not work for you (unless we've signed a contract).
Nothing here is a&nbsp;professional advice.
